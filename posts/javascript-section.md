For my first assignment I decided to create a blog with Next.js. I really had no idea where to begin, so I decided to go with the tutorial I had seen by [Brad Traversy](https://youtu.be/MrjeefD8sac). I was really impressed by the simplicity of the tutorial, so I decided to follow it. However, that doesn't I totally understood everything I did. No doubt, I want to go through the tutorial again....stay tuned!
